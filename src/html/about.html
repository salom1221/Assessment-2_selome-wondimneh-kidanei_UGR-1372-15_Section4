          <h1>About Freya Clothing</h1>
          <p><strong>

            Freya Clothing was founded with a vision to celebrate individuality, self-expression, and the beauty of the unconventional.</strong></p>
            <br>
            <p>Inspired by Freya, the Norse goddess of love, beauty, and war, the brand embodies a duality that reflects strength and elegance. We chose the name "Freya" because it symbolizes empowerment, creativity, and a fierce commitment to standing out. At Freya Clothing, we blend modern trends with timeless aesthetics to create pieces that resonate deeply with those who dare to be different.</p>
          
          
          <h1>Freya Clothing Aesthetics</h1>

           <h2> Emo (Gothic):</h2>
            Our emo-inspired designs channel raw emotion and introspection, fusing oversized silhouettes, dark tones, and edgy details. Think band tees, ripped layers, and dramatic accents that reflect a deep connection to music and self-expression.
            
            <h2>Dark Academia:</h2>
            For the intellectual and mysterious, our dark academia collection features structured tailoring, muted tones, and vintage-inspired pieces. Plaid patterns, blazers, and flowing skirts create a look that bridges sophistication and rebellion.
            
            <h2>Y2K:</h2>
            Nostalgia meets modernity in our Y2K aesthetic. Metallic fabrics, playful crop tops, flared pants, and bold accessories celebrate the tech-fueled optimism and rebellious spirit of the early 2000s.
            
           <h2> Grunge:</h2>
            Our grunge line is rooted in authenticity and rebellion. Flannel shirts, distressed denim, combat boots, and layered textures bring a sense of effortless cool that captures the heart of 90s counterculture.</p>
